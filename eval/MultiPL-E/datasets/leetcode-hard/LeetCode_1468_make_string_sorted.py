def make_string_sorted(s: str) -> int:
    """
    You are given a string s (0-indexed)​​​​​​. You are asked to perform the following operation on s​​​​​​ until you get a sorted string:

    Find the largest index i such that 1 <= i < s.length and s[i] < s[i - 1].
    Find the largest index j such that i <= j < s.length and s[k] < s[i - 1] for all the possible values of k in the range [i, j] inclusive.
    Swap the two characters at indices i - 1​​​​ and j​​​​​.
    Reverse the suffix starting at index i​​​​​​.

    Return the number of operations needed to make the string sorted. Since the answer can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
    Example 1:

    Input: s = "cba"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The simulation goes as follows:
    Operation 1: i=2, j=2. Swap s[1] and s[2] to get s="cab", then reverse the suffix starting at 2. Now, s="cab".
    Operation 2: i=1, j=2. Swap s[0] and s[2] to get s="bac", then reverse the suffix starting at 1. Now, s="bca".
    Operation 3: i=2, j=2. Swap s[1] and s[2] to get s="bac", then reverse the suffix starting at 2. Now, s="bac".
    Operation 4: i=1, j=1. Swap s[0] and s[1] to get s="abc", then reverse the suffix starting at 1. Now, s="acb".
    Operation 5: i=2, j=2. Swap s[1] and s[2] to get s="abc", then reverse the suffix starting at 2. Now, s="abc".

    Example 2:

    Input: s = "aabaa"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The simulation goes as follows:
    Operation 1: i=3, j=4. Swap s[2] and s[4] to get s="aaaab", then reverse the substring starting at 3. Now, s="aaaba".
    Operation 2: i=4, j=4. Swap s[3] and s[4] to get s="aaaab", then reverse the substring starting at 4. Now, s="aaaab".

 
    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 3000
    s​​​​​​ consists only of lowercase English letters.
