def minimumSize(nums: List[int], maxOperations: int) -> int:
    """
    You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.
    You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:

    Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.


    For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.



    Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.
    Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    - Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
    - Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
    The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    - Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
    - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
    - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
    - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
    The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2, and you should return 2.

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109
