def findShortestSubArray(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
    Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 
    The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
    Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
    [1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
    The shortest length is 2. So return 2.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    The degree is 3 because the element 2 is repeated 3 times.
    So [2,2,3,1,4,2] is the shortest subarray, therefore returning 6.

Â 
    Constraints:

    nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
    nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.
