# Library

If you want to use TaskWeaver as a library, you can refer to the following code example:

```python
from taskweaver.app.app import TaskWeaverApp

# This is the folder that contains the taskweaver_config.json file and not the repo root. Defaults to "./project/"
app_dir = "./project/"
app = TaskWeaverApp(app_dir=app_dir)
session = app.get_session()

user_query = "hello, what can you do?"
response_round = session.send_message(user_query)
print(response_round.to_dict())
```
**Note:**
- `response_round`: the response from TaskWeaver. which is an object of the `Round` class. 
  An example of the `Round` object is shown below:
```json

    "id": "round-20231201-043134-218a2681",
    "user_query": "hello, what can you do?",
