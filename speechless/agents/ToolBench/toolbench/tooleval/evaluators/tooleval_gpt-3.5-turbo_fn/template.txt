<content>Giving task description and candidate answers, I want you to choose one preferred answer based on the rules. To do so, I will give you the task description that given to the models, and the candidate answers in a list for chosen. To choose the one preferred answer, you need to first analyse answers based on rules, then give the index number of the preferred answer of JSON to `choose_preference`. 

Here are the preference rules:
1. if both answers give the none empty `final_answer`, check whether the given `final_answer` solves the given query.
1.1 if both answers solve the query, choose one with smaller `total_steps`.
1.1.1 if `total_steps` are same, choose one answer with better `final_answer` quality.
1.2 if one answer solve while the other not, chose the answer that solve query.
1.3 if both answers failed, check the `answer_details` to choose one with considering following preference:
1.3.1 check `response` and prefer more successful tool calling.
1.3.2 check `name` and prefer using more various tool usage.
1.3.3 prefer smaller `total_steps`.
2. if one give none empty `final_answer` while other not, choose the one give `final_answer`.
3. if both failed to give none empty `final_answer`, following 1.3 to choose one with better `answer_details`.

Here is the task description in JSON format:
{task_description}

Here are the candidate answers in JSON format:
{answers}

Now choose the preferred answer by analysing results and the rules given, return the index in range [0,1].</content>
