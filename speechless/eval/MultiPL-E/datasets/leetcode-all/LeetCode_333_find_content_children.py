    """
    Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
    Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
    And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
    You need to output 1.

    Example 2:

    Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
    You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
    You need to output 2.

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
    0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
    1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1

    """
    ### Canonical solution below ###
    g.sort()
    s.sort()
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
        if s[j] >= g[i]:
            i += 1

        j += 1
