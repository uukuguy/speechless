def best_rotation(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    You are given an array nums. You can rotate it by a non-negative integer k so that the array becomes [nums[k], nums[k + 1], ... nums[nums.length - 1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]. Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.

    For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

    Return the rotation index k that corresponds to the highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index k.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,3,1,4,0]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Scores for each k are listed below: 
    k = 0,  nums = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
    k = 1,  nums = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
    k = 2,  nums = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
    k = 3,  nums = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
    k = 4,  nums = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3
    So we should choose k = 3, which has the highest score.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,3,0,2,4]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: nums will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.
    So we will choose the smallest k, which is 0.

    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    0 <= nums[i] < nums.length

    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n):
        change[(i - nums[i] + 1 + n) % n] -= 1
        change[(i + 1) % n] += 1

    max_score = 0
    cur_score = change[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        cur_score += change[i]
