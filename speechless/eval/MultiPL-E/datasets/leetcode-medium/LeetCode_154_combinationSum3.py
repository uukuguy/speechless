def combinationSum3(k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

    Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
    Each number is used at most once.

    Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: k = 3, n = 7
    Output: [[1,2,4]]
    Explanation:
    1 + 2 + 4 = 7
    There are no other valid combinations.
    Example 2:

    Input: k = 3, n = 9
    Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
    Explanation:
    1 + 2 + 6 = 9
    1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    2 + 3 + 4 = 9
    There are no other valid combinations.

    Example 3:

    Input: k = 4, n = 1
    Output: []
    Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
    Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.

Â 
    Constraints:

    2 <= k <= 9
    1 <= n <= 60
