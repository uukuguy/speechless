# Text2SQL Research Status and Challenges: A Comprehensive Survey

Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) models represent a pivotal area of research, aiming to bridge the gap between natural language understanding and database querying. These models take natural language questions and database schemas as input, generating executable SQL queries to retrieve information from databases. The research in this domain has evolved significantly, with numerous benchmarks and techniques emerging to enhance performance and robustness. This survey delves into the current state of Text2SQL research, examining the key advancements, challenges, and future directions.

## Current State of Text2SQL Research

### Benchmarking and Model Development

The development of large-scale datasets like WikiSQL and SPIDER has been instrumental in the advancement of Text2SQL models, enabling the adoption of deep learning techniques and significant performance improvements <sup>1</sup>\. These datasets have facilitated the training of models capable of handling diverse database structures and query types, leading to more sophisticated and context-aware systems <sup>1</sup>\. Recent benchmarks such as KaggleDBQA, SEDE, and EHRSQL have further expanded the scope of Text2SQL research, capturing real-world scenarios and testing model robustness <sup>1</sup>\. Dr. SPIDER, a perturbed version of the SPIDER benchmark, specifically targets the evaluation of model robustness under text or schema perturbations <sup>1</sup>\.

### Ambiguity and Advanced Analysis

Ambiguity, particularly in SQL queries, presents a significant challenge in Text2SQL research. Existing studies have primarily focused on column ambiguity, neglecting other forms of ambiguity that arise in complex queries <sup>1</sup>\. This limitation underscores the need for more robust systems capable of handling ambiguous queries effectively <sup>1</sup>\. Additionally, current research often focuses on basic tasks like Text2SQL and TableQA, neglecting advanced analysis tasks such as forecasting and chart generation <sup>2</sup>\. The Text2Analysis benchmark addresses this gap by incorporating advanced analysis tasks that require in-depth analysis beyond SQL-compatible operations, further pushing the boundaries of Text2SQL research <sup>2</sup>\.

### User Interaction and Adaptation

Recent advancements in Text2SQL research have also focused on enhancing user interaction and adaptation. Techniques have been proposed to allow users to validate and refine generated queries through step-by-step explanations, promoting a more interactive and user-friendly experience <sup>3</sup>\. Additionally, research has explored multi-turn SQL generation, where models must reason about dialog context and encode historical queries, indicating a shift towards more context-aware systems <sup>3</sup>\. The REFILL framework addresses the challenge of adapting Text2SQL parsers to new databases by synthesizing high-quality and textually diverse parallel datasets, leading to improved parser performance <sup>3</sup>\.

## Challenges in Text2SQL Research

### Handling Ambiguity and Complexity

The task of Text-to-SQL generation involves deep reasoning across database structures, SQL semantics, and natural language understanding, making it inherently complex <sup>4</sup>\. Predicting various components like aggregation operators, selection and condition column names, conditional operators, and values requires advanced models capable of handling multiple conditions and nuanced query structures <sup>4</sup>\. Addressing ambiguity and complexity in queries remains a significant challenge in developing robust Text2SQL systems.

### Social Biases and Fairness

Large pre-trained language models, including those used in Text2SQL tasks, are known to carry social biases that can lead to unfair decisions in real-world applications <sup>5</sup>\. Existing models are typically trained on clean, neutral datasets, which may mask social biases under ideal conditions. However, these biases can emerge in real-world scenarios, highlighting the importance of assessing and mitigating biases in Text2SQL models to prevent harmful outcomes <sup>5</sup>\.

### Benchmark Evaluation and Accuracy

Evaluating Text-to-SQL models using benchmarks is crucial for assessing progress and model ranking. However, several issues complicate accurate evaluation, including underspecified natural language queries, inherent assumptions in both model-generated and reference queries, and the non-deterministic nature of SQL output under certain conditions <sup>6</sup>\. Achieving perfect performance on these benchmarks is unfeasible due to multiple interpretations of provided samples, and the true performance of models is often underestimated <sup>6</sup>\.
