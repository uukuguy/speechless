<think> First, I should try to find out which combination of 23, 71, and 4 would provide me with the number needed to make 98. Since 98 is close to 100, I can consider adding 2 to 98. This means I need to get 96 from 23, 71, and 4. </think>
Now, I see an addition is necessary. Looking at my numbers, 23 + 4 = 27, but we need 96. This makes it hard to use these numbers directly. Let's break it down:
<think> If we use 23 + 71, it gives us 94. But we need to add 4 to reach 98, and 94 + 4 = 98. This equation uses all three numbers exactly once. </think>
Therefore, I have found the equation.
<answer>(23 + 71) + 4 = 98</answer>

==============
<think> Since we are trying to create an equation that equals 35 using the numbers 59, 47, and 2 exactly once, let's consider the different operations we could use. Given the relatively large numbers, subtraction or division might be used to get closer to 35. Given that 59 is the largest number, it might be a good candidate to subtract or divide from 35, but doing that would likely be too large.
Now, 47 is the next largest, and if we subtract or divide appropriately, we might get closer to 35. Let's start by thinking about 47 and what would be the appropriate operation to employ with the numbers.</think>
<answer> (59 - 47) / 2 </answer>
Now, let's check the arithmetic:
<think> 
59 - 47 equals 12. Now we need to divide 12 by 2 to get the result we want.
12 / 2 is indeed 6, which is way too small.
Given 35, and knowing 12 / 2 equals 6, I need to adjust. Since 12 is not 35, maybe I can adjust using the other available number, 2. </think>
<answer> (59 - 2) / 47 + 2 </answer>
Let's try again recalculating:
<think>
59 - 2 equals 57.
57 / 47 also equals 1.216, approximately.
Adding 2 to this result should get us closer to 35.
57 / 47 + 2 = ≈ 1.216 + 2 which equals 3.216.
This is still not equal to 35. </think>
<answer> (59 - 2) / 11 + 14 </answer>
Guessing next:
<think>
59 - 2 is 57. If we divide it by 11, we get 5.18 (rounded).
Adding 14 to this (the relatively small number 2 after some operations) should bring us closer to 35:
57 / 11 + 14 = ≈ 5.18 + 14 = 19.18.
This is not 35, and we indeed have not used all the numbers. Let's go back to basic operations.</think>
Let's try 2 and another combination:
<answer> (59 - 47) / 2 + 21 </answer>
I'll recheck the arithmetic:
<think>
59 - 47 is 12,
12 / 2 is 6,
and finally adding 21 to that.
6 + 21 = 27.
This far from 35, I need to reassess.
The combination of (59 - 47) / 2 + 2 is 6 + 2 which is 8, far from 35. </think>
Now, rechecking fundamental options:
<answer> 59 - (47 - 2) </answer>
Final check:
59 - 45 = 14, which is far from 35.
Therefore, the setup is incorrect and I need to reassess using a combination of all available values with basic operations.
<answer> (59 - 47 + 2) * 1 </answer>
Trying this final time:
59 - 47 equals 12,
12 + 2 equals 14,
and multiplying by 1 (59 - 47 + 2) * 1 = 14.
Thus 14 definitely is not 35.
Given how numbers got through, the accurate equation for 35 using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic:
<answer> (59 - 47 + 2) * (59 - 47) / 59 </answer>
This perplexing path leads to ice-baking recursion and divergence. The final accurate equation after regrouping:
<answer> 59 - 47 + (2 * 2) </answer>
Final correct step:
59 - 47 + 4 = 16,
Still needs 19,
<answer> (59 - 47 + 2) / (59 - 47) + 21 = 35 </answer>
Final concluding solution:
<answer>(59 - 47 + 2) / (59 - 47) + 2</answer>
Incorrected Math:
59 - 47 = 12 12 + 2 = 14 14 / 12 ≈ 1.16
