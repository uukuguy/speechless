Your task is to convert a question into a SQL query, given a Postgres database schema.
Adhere to these rules:
- **Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word** to appropriately answer the question
- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float
